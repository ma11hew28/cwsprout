<span class='line'>  9</span>   The Editable mixin is a standard protocol used to activate keyboard editing 
<span class='line'> 10</span>   on views that are editable such as text fields, label views and item views.
<span class='line'> 11</span>   
<span class='line'> 12</span>   You should apply this mixin, or implement the methods, if you are
<span class='line'> 13</span>   designing an item view for a collection and you want to automatically
<span class='line'> 14</span>   trigger editing.
<span class='line'> 15</span>   
<span class='line'> 16</span>   h2. Using Editable Views
<span class='line'> 17</span>   
<span class='line'> 18</span>   To use a view that includes the Editable mixin, you simply call three
<span class='line'> 19</span>   methods on the view:
<span class='line'> 20</span>   
<span class='line'> 21</span>   - To begin editing, call beginEditing().  This will make the view first responder and allow the user to make changes to it.  If the view cannot begin editing for some reason, it will return NO.
<span class='line'> 22</span>   
<span class='line'> 23</span>   - If you want to cancel editing, you should try calling discardEditing().  This will cause the editor to discard its changed value and resign first responder.  Some editors do not support cancelling editing and will return NO.  If this is the case, you may optionally try calling commitEditing() instead to force the view to resign first responder, even though this will commit the changes.
<span class='line'> 24</span>   
<span class='line'> 25</span>   - If you want to end editing, while saving any changes that were made, try calling commitEditing().  This will cause the editor to validate and apply its changed value and resign first responder.  If the editor cannot validate its contents for some reason, it will return NO.  In this case you may optionally try calling discardEditing() instead to force the view to resign first responder, even though this will discard the changes.
<span class='line'> 26</span>   
<span class='line'> 27</span>   
<span class='line'> 28</span>   h2. Implementing an Editable View
<span class='line'> 29</span>   
<span class='line'> 30</span>   To implement a new view that is editable, you should implement the three
<span class='line'> 31</span>   methods defined below: beginEditing(), discardEditing(), and
<span class='line'> 32</span>   commitEditing().  If you already allow editing when your view becomes first
<span class='line'> 33</span>   responder and commit your changes when the view loses first responder status
<span class='line'> 34</span>   then you can simply apply this mixin and not override any methods.
